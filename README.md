# Agricultural UAV System – SCI Lab, UCLA

## Introduction

This repository hosts the system integration codebase for an **agricultural unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)** platform developed at the **SCI Lab, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)**.

The platform is designed to support onboard perception, state estimation, and autonomous decision-making using a Jetson-based companion computer, enabling low-latency and network-independent operation in field environments.

## System Overview

The system integrates the following components:

- **Flight Control**  
  A mature autopilot stack, PX4, is used for low-level stabilization, flight modes, and fail-safe handling.

- **Onboard Compute**  
  An **NVIDIA Jetson** companion computer executes perception, state estimation, task logic, and data logging fully onboard. (Holybro Pixhawk Jetson Baseboard)

- **Perception & Sensors**  
  The system uses an Intel RealSense D455 depth camera, which provides synchronized stereo images and IMU measurements.

- **State Estimation (VIO)**  
  Visual–inertial odometry is implemented using the open_vins framework, which fuses camera and IMU data to estimate the UAV pose and velocity in real time.

- **Task-Level Control**  
  High-level control commands are generated by a separate task or autonomy module based on the estimated state and perception inputs, and are sent to the flight controller through a safety-bounded interface.

- **Middleware**  
  **ROS 2** is used as the middleware for data handling, visualization, and modular control logic, with standardized topics, timestamps, and coordinate frames (TF).
